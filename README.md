General Notes
1. Robot Index ALWAYS starts with 1
2. Robot seems to pull the first data to fill in the [0] element of a list using  the first element: [1] (index 1, see no. 1 above)
3. To fix the difference in indexing, all data extracted from Robot would be placed in [0] of any list in Python:
    follow the step extract then process. All processes should be done after all data extraction
